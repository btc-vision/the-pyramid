# The Octahedron Chamber

You enter the heart of the dungeon. A massive octahedron rotates slowly at the center, its eight faces reflecting eight different realities.

**[View the Octahedron Guardian](../models/octahedron.stl)**

Eight voices speak as one:

*"We are the Octahedron. We see above and below, left and right, forward and backward, inside and outside. Nothing escapes our eight faces."*

*"You seek the exit. We guard the exit. This is our purpose."*

*"Prove your worth. What is the dual of a cube?"*
