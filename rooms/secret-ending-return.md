# The Geometer Supreme

*"A wise choice. Power without isolation. Knowledge without sacrifice."*

The Hypercube extends a vertex into three-dimensional space. It touches your forehead. Knowledge floods your mind — every theorem ever proven, every shape ever conceived, every relationship between form and space.

You return to your world. But now you see EVERYTHING.

The spiral of a snail shell — a logarithmic curve. The hexagons of a honeycomb — optimal packing. The branching of trees — fractal recursion. The orbits of planets — conic sections.

The universe is mathematics made manifest. And you can read it like a book.

## SECRET ENDING: The Geometer Supreme

You become the greatest mathematician in human history. Your theorems reshape science. Your proofs unlock technologies thought impossible. Students speak your name with reverence.

But sometimes, late at night, you look up at the stars and remember the Hypercube's other offer. The path not taken. The dimension not explored.

You made the right choice. Probably. Almost certainly.

...Right?
