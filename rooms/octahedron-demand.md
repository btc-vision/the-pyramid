# The Direct Approach

The octahedron pauses. Eight faces blink in confusion.

*"You... refuse the riddle?"*

*"None have ever refused the riddle. It is tradition. It is protocol. It is... geometry."*

A long pause. The eight voices confer in whispered angles.

Finally, the eight voices speak again:

*"We... respect your directness. Too long have we guarded this place with puzzles and games. You remind us that sometimes the shortest path between two points is simply... a line."*

*"Very well. The exit is yours. But know that you have changed nothing. You have learned nothing. You leave as you entered."*

A door appears. Plain. Simple. Geometric.

*Sometimes the answer is to refuse the question.*
