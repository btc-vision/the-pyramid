# Spherical Confusion

*"A SPHERE?!"*

All eight faces of the octahedron turn various shades of geometric rage.

*"A sphere has INFINITE faces! It is the limit of polygons, not a polygon itself! It has no vertices! No edges! It is the ANTITHESIS of discrete geometry!"*

The chamber begins to collapse inward. The octahedron expands, its eight faces becoming walls, floor, and ceiling.

*"You will remain here until you learn the difference between polytopes and their limits."*

## BAD ENDING: Trapped in Eight Dimensions

You are now sealed within an octahedral prison. Eight faces watch you eternally. You have lots of time to study geometry now.

*"The dual of ignorance is education. Perhaps in a few millennia you will understand."*
