# Violence Was Never the Answer

You swing at the cube. Your fist passes through one face and out another. The cube is unimpressed.

*"You attack geometry itself? Fool."*

The cube doesn't fight back. It simply... rotates. And keeps rotating. Faster. FASTER.

The rotation creates a vortex. You're pulled in, stretched across all six faces simultaneously. Your consciousness is divided equally among eight vertices.

## BAD ENDING: Distributed

You exist now as a probability field across the cube's geometry. Every corner holds 12.5% of your soul. Math class finally killed you.
