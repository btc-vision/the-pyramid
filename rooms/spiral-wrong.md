# Donut? DONUT?!

The spiral freezes. Its light turns a furious red.

*"A DONUT? You dare compare topology to PASTRY?!"*

*"A torus has an INSIDE and an OUTSIDE! A Möbius strip has NEITHER! Do they not teach mathematics in your dimension?!"*

The spiral begins unwinding. It wraps around you like an angry mathematical serpent.

*"You will now learn the difference... BY BECOMING A KLEIN BOTTLE!"*

Your inside becomes your outside. Your outside becomes your inside. You are a four-dimensional nightmare trapped in three dimensions. It doesn't hurt, but it's DEEPLY uncomfortable.
