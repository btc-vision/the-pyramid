# The Pharaoh's Disappointment

*"A pyramid? A PYRAMID?! I AM a pyramid, you fool! Would you answer 'human' if asked what has two legs?!"*

The inverted pyramid begins to spin. The Pharaoh's rage is geometric and absolute.

*"Pyramids have FIVE faces! The base! THE BASE! Did 4,000 polygons of waiting teach you nothing about counting?!"*

The spinning creates a vortex that pulls you in. You are sealed within the pyramid for eternity, your body becoming one of its faces.

## BAD ENDING: Entombed

You are now the sixth face of a pentahedron. The geometry is wrong. It hurts. Forever.
