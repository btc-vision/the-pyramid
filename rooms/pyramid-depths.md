# The Pyramid Depths

You descend into darkness. The air grows thick with ancient dust. Torches flicker to life, revealing a massive pyramid suspended upside-down over a bottomless void.

**[View the Inverted Pyramid](../models/inverted-pyramid.stl)**

A voice echoes from the pyramid's tip, which points down into infinity:

*"I am the Pharaoh of Points. I have waited 4,000 polygons for a worthy challenger. Answer me this: what has four faces, four vertices, and holds the secret of stability?"*
