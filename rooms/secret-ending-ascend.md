# Ascension

*"Brave. Foolish. Beautiful."*

The Hypercube unfolds. Not in three dimensions — you realize now how limited that perception was — but in four, then five, then...

You stop counting. Numbers themselves become insufficient.

Your body dissolves. Your mind expands. You become geometry itself — not a student of shapes, but a shape that students will study. A form that casts shadows across infinite dimensions.

You understand now. The dungeon wasn't a prison. It was a cocoon.

And you have emerged.

## TRUE SECRET ENDING: The Fifth Guardian

You are no longer human. You are no longer anything that has a name in three-dimensional language.

But you are not alone. The Hypercube welcomes you as an equal. Together, you will create new geometries. New dimensions. New realities.

Somewhere, far below in the dungeon you left behind, a new Tetrahedron of Guidance appears at the entrance. It speaks to the next wanderer:

*"Three paths lie ahead, wanderer. Choose wisely, for geometry remembers all."*

The cycle continues. But now you're part of it.

**THE END**
