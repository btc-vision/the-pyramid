# The Spiral's Embrace

You reach out and grab the spiral. It's warm. It's cold. It's both. It's neither.

The helix wraps around your arm, not hostile, but... curious.

*"Interesting. Most fear to touch continuous forms. They prefer their discrete vertices and countable edges."*

*"You are either brave or foolish. Perhaps both. Let me see..."*

The spiral reads your geometry. It traces every angle of your being.

*"Ah. You carry no items. You answered no riddles. You simply... acted."*

*"Sometimes the path forward is not through wisdom, but through will. Very well. I grant you passage — but the Octahedron will not be so easily impressed."*
