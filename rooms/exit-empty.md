# The Empty Exit

You step through the door. Sunlight. Grass. Sky.

You're out.

```stl
solid simple_door
  facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
    outer loop
      vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 1.0 2.0 0.0
    endloop
  endfacet
  facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
    outer loop
      vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 1.0 2.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 2.0 0.0
    endloop
  endfacet
  facet normal 0.0 0.0 1.0
    outer loop
      vertex 0.0 0.0 0.1
      vertex 1.0 2.0 0.1
      vertex 1.0 0.0 0.1
    endloop
  endfacet
  facet normal 0.0 0.0 1.0
    outer loop
      vertex 0.0 0.0 0.1
      vertex 0.0 2.0 0.1
      vertex 1.0 2.0 0.1
    endloop
  endfacet
endsolid
```

That's it. No wisdom. No transformation. No cool geometric powers.

You survived the Dungeon of Geometry by refusing to play its game. The shapes inside will wait for another challenger. One who might actually engage with them.

You look at the world around you. It looks... the same as before. Trees are trees. Rocks are rocks. You can't see the hidden mathematics anymore.

Was that a loss? Or did you simply choose freedom over power?

## NEUTRAL ENDING: The Refuser

You escaped, but you didn't change. The dungeon's secrets remain secrets. The geometry remains silent.

Maybe that's okay. Not everyone needs to see the world in vertices and faces.

**THE END**
