# The Spiral Tower

You climb weathered stone steps that twist impossibly upward. The geometry defies logic — you're somehow always ascending yet never getting higher.

At the top, a helix of pure light awaits.

The Spiral speaks in frequencies:

*"I am continuous where others are discrete. I am the path that never ends. Tell me, wanderer: what shape has one face, one edge, and can be cut in half to become two interlocked rings?"*
