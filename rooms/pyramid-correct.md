# The Pharaoh's Gift

The inverted pyramid trembles. The Pharaoh's voice fills with something ancient and warm.

*"Correct! The tetrahedron — the simplest 3D form, yet the strongest. Four triangular faces cannot flex. You understand the sacred geometry."*

The pyramid rights itself and descends. From its peak, a small tetrahedron emerges, glowing with inner light.
