# The Spiral's Wisdom

The helix pulses with approval, its light cycling through infinite colors.

*"Yes! The Möbius strip — where inside becomes outside, where one surface twists into itself. You understand that boundaries are illusions."*

A ring of light separates from the spiral and encircles your wrist.

**Item Acquired: Spiral Band** — *Grants continuous perception. You see all paths as one.*

*"The Octahedron Chamber awaits. It guards the exit... and the truth."*
