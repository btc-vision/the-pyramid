# The Dual Truth

The octahedron stops rotating. All eight faces align to look at you simultaneously.

*"Correct. We are the cube's dual. Where the cube has vertices, we have faces. Where the cube has faces, we have vertices. We are two forms of the same truth."*

*"You understand duality. Light and dark. Form and void. Question and answer."*

The octahedron splits open, revealing a doorway of pure light.

*"Go now. Return to your world of curved surfaces and irrational numbers. But remember what you learned here: geometry is the language of reality itself."*

## GOOD ENDING: The Graduate

You step through the gateway and emerge into sunlight. The dungeon fades behind you like a half-remembered dream.

But something has changed. You see the world differently now. The angles. The relationships. The beautiful mathematics underlying everything.

You understand now that geometry isn't just shapes. It's the skeleton of existence.
