# The Final Chamber — Beyond Dimensions

You rise from the void, carrying its blessing. The chamber you enter exists outside normal space. Shapes orbit that shouldn't be possible — tesseracts casting shadows, Klein bottles containing themselves, Penrose triangles that hurt to look at.

At the center floats the Hypercube. The four-dimensional guardian of all geometry.

The Hypercube speaks in dimensions you can barely perceive:

*"Void Walker. You chose the path of faith over the path of knowledge. You leaped before you looked. And so you found what others never could."*

*"The cubes, pyramids, spirals, octahedrons — they are my shadows. Projections of my form into your limited three dimensions. You have proven yourself worthy of seeing... more."*

*"I offer you a choice. Return to your world as the greatest geometer who ever lived. Or... stay. Become the guardian of the fifth dimension. Help me cast shadows into realms that do not yet exist."*

| Choice | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Return as the Geometer Supreme | [Return](secret-ending-return.md) |
| Ascend to the Fifth Dimension | [Ascend](secret-ending-ascend.md) |

---

*The true ending awaits.*
