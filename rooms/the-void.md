# The Void

You jump. The Pharaoh screams something about "statistical improbability" but you're already falling.

Falling.

The darkness is absolute. You fall for what feels like hours. Days. Eons.

Then... you land softly on something that shouldn't exist.

A voice speaks from everywhere and nowhere:

*"You found me. The Tesseract's Shadow. I exist in the space between dimensions, where Euclidean rules are merely suggestions."*

*"You have proven yourself willing to leap into the unknown. For this, I grant you passage to the true ending."*
