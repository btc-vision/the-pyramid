# The Void

You jump. The Pharaoh screams something about "statistical improbability" but you're already falling.

Falling.

*Falling.*

The darkness is absolute. You fall for what feels like hours. Days. Eons.

Then... you land softly on something that shouldn't exist. A shape that defies Euclidean logic.

A voice speaks from everywhere and nowhere:

*"You found me. The Tesseract's Shadow. I exist in the space between dimensions, where Euclidean rules are merely suggestions."*

*"You have proven yourself willing to leap into the unknown. For this, I grant you passage to the true ending."*

**Secret Item Acquired: Void Walker's Blessing** — *You can now perceive the fourth dimension.*
