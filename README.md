# The Dungeon of Geometry

> A 3D choose-your-own-adventure game rendered entirely in GitHub Markdown.

You are **The Wanderer**, a being who stumbled into a forbidden geometric dungeon. The ancients sealed geometry itself within these walls. Your only way out is through.

## The Entrance

You stand before a massive stone gate. Strange symbols pulse with light. A floating **Tetrahedron of Guidance** hovers before you.

**[View the Tetrahedron of Guidance](models/tetrahedron-guide.stl)**

The tetrahedron speaks: *"Three paths lie ahead, wanderer. Choose wisely, for geometry remembers all."*
